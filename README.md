# dicee-challenge
It is one of those simple beginner's project which i made using html,css and js. It is just a simple dice game where you have refresh your page and the dices will give you outcomes and will decide either player 1 won or 2 or it is a draw between two. It will be displayed on the screen.If you want tp play again you just need to refresh it.
The main javascript library used here is jQuery.
